# ES6 Basics Project

This project focuses on practicing ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features in JavaScript. It includes tasks covering various ES6 concepts such as `const` and `let` variables, arrow functions, default parameters, rest parameters, spread syntax, template literals, object property shorthand, computed property names, method properties, for...of loops, and iterators.

## Tasks

### 0. Const or let?
- Modify `taskFirst` to instantiate variables using `const`.
- Modify `taskNext` to instantiate variables using `let`.

### 1. Block Scope
- Modify variables inside the function `taskBlock` to prevent overwriting inside the conditional block.

### 2. Arrow functions
- Rewrite a standard function to use ES6 arrow syntax.

### 3. Parameter defaults
- Condense the internals of a function to one line using default parameter values.

### 4. Rest parameter syntax for functions
- Modify a function to return the number of arguments passed to it using the rest parameter syntax.

### 5. The wonders of spread syntax
- Concatenate arrays and each character of a string using spread syntax.

### 6. Take advantage of template literals
- Rewrite a return statement to use template literals for variable substitution.

### 7. Object property value shorthand syntax
- Modify an object creation to use key names as variable names.

### 8. No need to create empty objects before adding in properties
- Rewrite a function to use computed property names on an object.

### 9. ES6 method properties
- Rewrite a function to use ES6 method properties in an object.

### 10. For...of Loops
- Rewrite a function to use ES6's for...of operator.

### 11. Iterator
- Write a function to create an object with department names and employees.

### 12. Let's create a report object
- Write a function to create a report object containing all employees and a method to get the number of departments.

### 13. Iterating through report objects
- Write a function to return an iterator to go through every employee in every department.

### 14. Iterate through object
- Write a function to return every employee name in a string, separated by '|'.

## Setup

- Install NodeJS 12.11.x
- Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint by running `npm install` in the project directory.
- Run `npm install` from the terminal of your project folder to install all necessary project dependencies.

## Testing

- All tasks are tested using the Jest Testing Framework.
- Run tests using `npm test`.

## Directory Structure

- All tasks are located in the `0x00-ES6_basic` directory.
- Each task has its own JavaScript file and corresponding test file.
